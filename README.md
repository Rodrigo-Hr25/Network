# Network

## Overview

This repository contains a series of network simulation projects designed to demonstrate practical skills in network configuration, topology design, and device management. The projects replicate real-world network scenarios using virtual machines, routers, and Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs), providing a hands-on experience with modern networking concepts.

## Project Objective

The main goal of these projects is to simulate realistic network environments where users can:

- Configure routers and switches.
- Establish secure and efficient network connections.
- Design and test different network topologies.
- Understand the behavior of networks under various configurations and constraints.

## Repository Structure

- **`VM_Proj1-1`**: First virtual machine project with fundamental network setup and configuration exercises.
- **`VM_Proj2-1`**: Second virtual machine project, expanding on the previous setup with more advanced networking scenarios.
- **`routers`**: Configuration files and scripts for routers, including routing tables, access lists, and interface setup.
- **`vpcs`**: Scripts and configurations for Virtual Private Clouds, simulating isolated network environments and interconnections.
- **`Rede.png`**: A visual diagram representing the network topology used across the projects.

## Key Features

- **Router Configuration**: Setting up routing protocols, interfaces, and access control lists.
- **Virtual Network Design**: Building and managing VPCs to simulate isolated networks.
- **Network Topology Simulation**: Designing complex topologies to test network performance and connectivity.
- **Hands-on Networking Practice**: Provides practical experience with real-world networking challenges.

## Skills Demonstrated

- **Network Design & Architecture**: Planning and implementing efficient network topologies.
- **Device Configuration**: Practical experience with routers, virtual machines, and VPCs.
- **Troubleshooting & Analysis**: Testing network behavior, identifying issues, and implementing solutions.
- **Documentation & Visualization**: Creating clear network diagrams and structured configuration files.

## Educational Context

These projects were developed as part of coursework and personal initiatives to enhance knowledge in networking and virtualized environments. They demonstrate both theoretical understanding and practical application of modern network design principles, suitable for showcasing in a professional portfolio.
